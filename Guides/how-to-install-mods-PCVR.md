# How to install mods for PCVR

Download your mod via [Nexus Mods PCVR](https://www.nexusmods.com/bladeandsorcery). If you are installing mods manually, choose "manual download". If you are using Vortex, choose "mod manager download".

## MANUAL INSTALL


1. Downloading your mod will give you an archived file. Double click the archive to open it and view the contents; you will need an archive manager like winrar or winzip to do this.

2. Open your B&S installation folder and go to StreamingAssets. The file path by default is C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Blade & Sorcery\BladeAndSorcery_Data\StreamingAssets\Mods

3. Drag your mod folder from the archive and drop it into StreamingAssets\Mods. Be sure to check that your mod folder is in StreamingAssets\Mods and not inside some subfolder. 
   It should look like this

   If you are seeing random numbers in your folder name, you have likely created a subfolder. Random subfolders can be accidentally created when extracting the folder from archive if you choose "extract to" instead of "extract here" or dragging the folder from the archive to the location.

4. Launch the game and your mod will be loaded.

## VORTEX INSTALL


1. Ensure Vortex is installed and setup correctly. If you are unfamiliar with Vortex, here is an installation video: [https://youtu.be/2JtNUPs0bqs?t=151](https://youtu.be/2JtNUPs0bqs?t=151)

2. When you click "mod manager download" the mod will begin automatically downloading via Vortex. Depending on your browser a popup may occur first asking your permission.

3. When the mod is downloaded it will appear in your mod list with a blue box that says "not installed". Click the dropdown on the box and choose "enable". The mod will install and the box will turn green.

4. If you get a popup asking you to "deploy" your mod, click yes to deploy.

5. Launch the game and your mods that are enabled will be loaded. You can use Vortex to enable and disable mods, so you could keep certain mods inactive but installed for later.

## COMMON MOD ISSUES


If your mods are not working in the game, here are the solutions to very common issues:

1. Ensure your mods are working for the version of B&S you have installed. Especially common when there is a big update, most mods will be obsolete and unplayable until the modder updates it. Most modders update to the latest version within a few days, but some mods may remain out of date and unusable if abandoned.

2. Make sure your mod folder is not in StreamingAssets\Mods and not inside a subfolder inside StreamingAssets\Mods. As mentioned in the install guide above, if you are seeing random numbers in your folder name you have likely installed your mod incorrectly and accidentally created a subfolder. https://i.imgur.com/AvpoJYH.png

3.  If using Vortex, ensure your mod is enabled and deployed if necessary.
