# Blade and Sorcery official U11 SDK

This SDK is used to create custom contents for the VR game "Blade and Sorcery".
The game currently support JSON/data modding, custom assets and plugins support (custom c# code).

This repository is still a work in progress and should evolve over time depending of game updates and community involvement.

For more information about the SDK and how to use it, I recommend to join the game [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/bladeandsorcery) and check the [Wiki](https://kospy.github.io/BasSDK/).
