# Holder
###### This component inherits from [Interactable][Interactable]. <br> This component has an [Event Linker][EventLinker].

## Overview
The holder component allows you to create a slot for items to be placed in. 

The behaviour of holders are determined by the `Interactable Data` linked by the `Interactable ID` property.   
Holders can be used to create quivers, weapon racks and weapon holsters on creatures.

Holder slots have a visual indicator for how held items will be oriented. This orientation is relative to the [holder point][HolderPoint] rather than the item itself.  
The Z axis (blue arrow) of the holder point will align with the purple arrow on the gizmo, while the Y axis (green arrow) will align with the green arrow.

### Setup
1. Create an empty object.
2. Select `Add Component` in the inspector and add the Holder component.
