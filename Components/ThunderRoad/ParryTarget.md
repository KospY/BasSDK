# Parry Target

![ParryTargetScript][ParryTargetScript]

The Parry Target script is a script needed on an [Item][Item] for the AI to detect your weapon and be able to parry it. When created, it creates a gizmo line, which you are to make extend the entire length of the weapon.

There is a button which allows you to move each end to fit the weapon, to allow an easy adjustment to the length of the Parry Target from point to point.
