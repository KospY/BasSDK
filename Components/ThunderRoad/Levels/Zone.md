# Zone

## Overview
Zones are a highly flexible tool for activating certain behaviours when an object or creature enter's its area of effect.

## Usage

### Basic Setup
1. Create an empty GameObject.
2. Select "Add Component" in the inspector window and choose any 3D collider to use as your Zone's area (Sphere Collider, Box Collider, Capsule Collider, etc).
3. Turn on "isTrigger" on the 3D collider component. 
4. Select "Add Component" in the inspector window and select the Zone component.

### Events
The Zone component has a number of UnityEvents that are invoked when something enters or exits its area of effect.

## Notes

### • Event Invocation Time
Entry events are invoked at inconsistent times. The chart below depicts the order in which zone effects are applied before the event is invoked.

| Event           | Order
| ---             | ---
| Player Entry    | Kill > Teleport > Update Portals > **Invoked** > Spawn Effect
| Creature Entry  | **Invoked** > Spawn Effect > Kill > Despawn
| Item Entry      | Spawn Effect > Teleport > Despawn > **Invoked**


### • Effect Spawn Position Behavior
Zone effects will not spawn at the exact point of contact, rather the position will be approximated based on the what entered the zone.
