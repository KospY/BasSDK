# Clothing Gender Switcher

The Clothing Gender Switcher is a script which swaps the mesh of armor part items depending on what gender the player is. This is used for apparel items, which are used to equip armor and clothing.

This script also allows to swap handles for the armor parts. If left blank, it will not change the handles on the object. 
For "Male Model" it will swap to the object referenced, and disable the "Female Model", if the player gender is set to Male, and vice versa.
