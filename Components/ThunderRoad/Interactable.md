## Component Fields

| Field               | Description

| Interactable ID     | The catalog ID that this interactable will use to define it's behaviour.
| Allowed Hand Side   | Which hands the interactable will acknowledge. 
| Axis Length         | Extends the touch radius along the y-axis (green arrow) by the length provided.
| Touch Radius        | How far a hand must be before the player can interact. 
| Artificial Distance | See the section [below](#-artifical-distance).
| Touch Center        | Determines the center of the touch radius. 

## Notes

### â€¢ Artifical Distance

When the player's hand is within the range of multiple interactables, the closest one is prioritized.  

Artifical distance is a fake distance added to the player's hand while checking which interactable is the nearest.  
Setting this to a high value gives it a **low priority** when working out which interactable to use, while a low (or negative) value will give it a **high priority** compared to other interactables.

Generally, you can leave this value at `0`.
