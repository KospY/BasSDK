# Heat Zone

{: .important}
This component requires a collider to be put on the gameObject before adding the script.

{: .note}
This component does not have any fields

The Heat Zone component is a script that will light torches in Blade and Sorcery. This will not imbue items with fire or light creatures on fire.
