# Reveal Decal

Reveal Decal is the script needed to spawn blood decals on weapons and props. The shader "ThunderRoad/Lit" is required for this, and requires a set up before Reveal starts working.

{: .tip}
You can copy the material from the example weapons provided in the SDK, as they are set up with Reveal already.
 

![RevealScript][RevealScript]

You can use the buttons on this script to set the resolution of the reveal material. It is recommended to keep this as low as possible to avoid any reveal texture size bloat. 

For examples from Blade and Sorcery:
- Common Dagger: 128x128
- The Maul: 512x512 (256x256 would also suffice)
- Antique Sword: 256x256
- Buckler: 256x256
- Javelin: 128x128
- Wristblade: 128x128
- Old Arrow: 64x64
- The Bandit Chestplate: 512x512 (1024x1024 would also be supported)

{: .danger}
It is recommended to keep the reveal resolution low to prevent the game to crash on `B&S Nomad`, or to cause a lag spike on `B&S PCVR`. It is recommended not to go above `512x512`, or `Mask Resolution Quarter`, to avoid any issues. You are unlikely to see a big change in resolutions above this point unless your item is very large.
