# Item

###### This component has an [Event Linker][EventLinker].

The `Item` script is the core component for items and weapons in Blade and Sorcery. This component is required for the item to work, and is a dependency on a lot of components listed on the weapon.

When this component is added, a Rigidbody is added to the object, as well as three gameobjects: HolderPoint, ParryPoint and [Preview][Preview]. 

{: .warning}
Do not adjust Rigidbody weight, drag and angular drag, as this is overwritten in the json.

## Component Properties

| Field                             | Description
| ---                               | ---
| Item ID                           | The Item ID should match what you put as `ID` in the Item JSON. Ensure that these components match.
| HolderPoint                       | The HolderPoint is a transform which depicts the rotation of the item when stored on a [Holder][Holder]. For example, the Z direction depicts downward direction when stored on the player sides or back.
| Additional HolderPoints           | Like `HolderPoint`, this allows adding more HolderPoints for specific holders. An example is the Weapon Rack in home, which utilises the `HolderRackTopAnchor` HolderPoint.
| ParryPoint                        | Shows the point that `AI` will try to block with when holding the weapon.
| Main Handle Left/Right            | Used for the handle that is grabbed by Default. See [Handle][Handle] to see handle setup.
| Fly Dir Ref                       | Used to point in this direction when thrown, so long as "Fly On Throw" is enabled in JSON. Z Axis / Blue arrow points forwards.
| Preview                           | Automatically added when `Item` script is added. See [Preview][Preview] for setup.
| Disallow Room Despawn             | When ticked, will not despawn when situated inside a Dungeon room.
| World Attached                    | Used for Items that are connected to the world. An example is hanging items and doors.
| Creature Physic Toggle Radius     | Radius to depict how close this item needs to be to a creature before the creatures' collision is enabled.
| Use Custom Center of Mass         | Allows user to adjust the center of mass on object. If unticked, this is automatically adjusted. When ticked, adds a custom gizmo to adjust. Use this if weight on the item is acting strange.
| Custom Inertia Tensor             | Used for balance adjustment on a weapon. Use this if swinging weapons are strange. Adjust the Capsule collider to the width of the weapon.
| Custom References                 | Allows a custom reference to be able to reference specific gameobjects and scripts in External code.
| Force Mesh Layer                  | Forces layer of mesh when an item is spawned (Items will have their layer automatically applied when spawned, unless this is set)
