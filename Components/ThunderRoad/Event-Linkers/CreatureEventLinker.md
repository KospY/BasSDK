# Creature Event Linker
*If you have not done so already, go read the [Event Linker][EventLinker]'s wiki page. This page only lists and explains the events available to this linker. It will not explain how to use the component itself.*

## Overview
The Creature Event Linker listens for events emitted from a specific creature.

A reference to a [Creature][Creature] component is required in order for this Event Linker to function.  
As of u11.2, this can only be done through custom scripting or by creating a custom creature.
